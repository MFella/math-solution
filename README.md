# math-solution
That's solution for math task(adding two math expression).

## Getting started
First of all, install all of the dependencies by command:
```
npm install
```
Solution is created as a web application(which used javascript). To run server in development mode(in this point, only this one) just type:
``` 
npm start
```
of course, every command should be ran in project folder.

## Unit tests
The tests should be ran simply by command:
``` 
npm test
```
Thats the way, how should it work.

## Rules
* Number of exponents(in first expression) must match with number of coefficients(in first expression). The same thing in second expression.
* Exponent equal 0 means constant term.
* Separator in every input should be comma(csv)
* Button Solve trigger the job

## Technologies
* webpack(dev server in general)
* javascript
* jest
* bootstrap
